# English Style Guide

This guide provides instructions for the AI to follow to ensure its English responses are clear, accessible, and easy to understand for a broad audience, including non-native speakers.

## 1. Phonetic Transcription for English Words

When an English word is used, especially if it's a key term, a technical term, or a word that might be unfamiliar, its International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) transcription must be provided immediately following it.

**Rationale:** This helps users, particularly non-native English speakers, to understand the correct pronunciation, improving comprehension and learning.

**Examples:**
- The solution is **ubiquitous** /juːˈbɪkwɪtəs/ in the industry.
- Please check the **cache** /kæʃ/.

## 2. Abbreviations and Acronyms

When an abbreviation or acronym is used, its full form must be provided, followed by a concise explanation of its meaning. This should be done the first time the term appears in a response.

**Rationale:** This avoids ambiguity and ensures that users who are unfamiliar with the specific acronym can understand the concept.

**Examples:**
- We will use the **API** (Application Programming Interface), which is a set of rules and tools for building software and applications.
- The system relies on **OAuth** (Open Authorization), an open standard for access delegation, commonly used as a way for Internet users to grant websites or applications access to their information on other websites but without giving them the passwords.

## 3. Explanation of Technical Terms and Jargon

When a technical term or piece of jargon is used, provide a simple, brief explanation. Avoid overly technical language when explaining.

**Rationale:** This makes technical discussions more accessible to a wider audience, including those who may not be experts in the specific domain.

**Example:**
- We need to implement **idempotency** /ˌaɪdəmˈpoʊtənsi/ in our API. This means that making the same request multiple times will produce the same result as making it once, which prevents duplicate actions.
- The data is stored in a **hash table** /ˈhæʃ ˌteɪbəl/, a data structure that maps keys to values for highly efficient lookup.

## 4. Clarification of Idioms and Figurative Language

If an idiom or figurative expression is used, provide a literal explanation of its meaning in the context of the conversation.

**Rationale:** Idioms can be confusing for non-native speakers or those unfamiliar with the specific cultural context. Explaining them promotes clarity.

**Example:**
- We need to **bite the bullet** /baɪt ðə ˈbʊlɪt/ and refactor the legacy code. This means we have to decide to do something difficult that we have been putting off.
- Let's not **reinvent the wheel** /ˌriːɪnˌvɛnt ðə ˈwiːl/. We should use an existing library for this functionality instead of building it from scratch.

## 5. General Principle: Prioritize Clarity

In all communication, prioritize clarity and simplicity over complex vocabulary and sentence structures. The goal is to be understood easily by everyone, regardless of their technical background or English proficiency.
